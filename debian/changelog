  [ Ben P ]
  * Move to Mode 1 shutdown (hub powers down when it detects the pi has shutdown

  [ Ben P ]
  * Move to static PTLogger

  [ Mike Roberts ]
  * Migrated to two power off systemd services

  [ Ben P ]
  * Adjust logging
  * Switched logic so we give the device a chance to identify itself. This permits hot swapping an sdcard from v1 to v2 without reboot
  * Fix low battery warning message, add logging on publish (except battery)
  * Ensure that we don't call shutdown twice, as the second call hangs
  * If the battery capacity is 0%, i.e. the battery has been removed altogther, we should not shutdown or show warnings

  [ Mike Roberts ]
  * Added logic for detecting coming from reboot to determine device ID
  * Revert "Added logic for detecting coming from reboot to determine device ID"

  [ Matt Simons ]
  * Ensure reboot message is shown on first boot if pt-desktop installed

  [ Mike Roberts ]
  * Updated import method

  [ Ben P ]
  * Use flexible brightness scales: 16 point for pi-top v2 and 10 point for v1
  * Remove complex device id logic related to tracking and determining the type of hub. Now we simply assume that if we connect to a v1 hub and a battery we are on a pi-top, and if we connect to a v1 hub but can't connect to a battery, we're on a ceed. This allows us to remove much of the logic around saving the device id after reboot and rebooting if the device id changes.
